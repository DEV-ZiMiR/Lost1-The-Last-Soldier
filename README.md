## [Alpha v0.7] – Coming Soon 🚀

🔥 **The biggest and most exciting update yet!**  
Alpha v0.7 brings real depth to the game: pets with unique buffs, a zoo shop, new weapons, teleport, an in-game time system, and a full Bestiary. This update makes the game more fun, alive, and diverse — giving the world new layers of strategy and exploration.

### ✨ What’s New
- **Pets + Zoo Shop**  
  → Collect pets with buffs (speed, HP, damage, regen, shield, etc.). Buy boxes at the Zoo Shop, check rarity, and build your rarest collection.  
- **New Weapons**  
  → Automatic weapons (rifles) and improved projectile system with effects (fire, ice, poison) — new tactics and combat options.  
- **Teleport Item**  
  → Quickly return to the starting point when used — saving time and adding convenience.  
- **Game Time System (Day/Night)**  
  → Full cycle: 5 minutes = 1 in-game day (3 min day / 2 min night). Night adds atmosphere — darkening and shaders.  
- **Bestiary (Monster, Location & Item Encyclopedia)**  
  → Gather info about enemies, areas, and items — icons, stats, and descriptions.

### 🖥️ Updated UI
- Full pet menu: list, details, "Select", "Sell"
